# Wireless 3D Bunny Orientation Control

This sub-directory contains a modified version of the bunny rotation demo seen [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor/processing-test). This modified version of the demo transmitted the data recieved from the BNO055 sensor to the computer running the processing application over an AES-128 encrypted data link via use of two NRF24L01 modules.

## Demo Video

A YouTube video depicting the functionallity implemented here can be seen below.
